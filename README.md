# ðŸ“Œ  Global_tech Population Analysis


Exploratory data analysis of global population data from 2000â€“2010 across continents and countries, using Python. Completed as part of a technical data analyst assessment.

# ðŸ“Œ  Aim

To analyze a historical global population dataset to answer a series of targeted analytical questions, derive meaningful insights, and provide recommendations based on observed trends.


# ðŸ“Œ  Project Overview 

The project involved working with a dataset titled population.csv which contained:

* Population data for 213 countries,

* Across 6 continents,

* Over the period from 2000 to 2010.

Key components of the project:

* Data loading and cleaning using pandas,

* Exploratory data analysis (EDA),

* Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn,

* Statistical summarization and reporting,

* Business insights and recommendations for policymakers.


# ðŸ“Œ  Methodology 

Data Loading & Inspection:

* Imported the CSV into a pandas DataFrame.

* Checked for missing values and data types.

* Identified unique country and continent entries.

Data Cleaning:

* Handled 8 missing entries in the population column.

* Filtered data by year, continent, and country as required by the questions.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

* Descriptive statistics for key variables.

* Filtered and grouped data to answer each question.

* Generated visualizations (line plot, scatterplot, bar plot, and boxplot).

Visualization:

Created multiple charts to show trends and outliers:

  * Time-series trends,

  * Continental population distributions,

  * Outliers in population figures.


# ðŸ“Œ  Observations

* 213 countries were tracked across 6 continents and 11 years.

* 8 missing values in the population column.

* Asia showed the highest population values consistently.

* Europe exhibited a population decline from 2000 to 2010.

# ðŸ“Œ  Key Insights from the Project

* 154 countries had 0 population values in 2000, suggesting missing or unreported data.

* Africa's total population in 2010 was relatively low at 56 (units)â€”possibly normalized or scaled in the dataset.

* The average population of South America in 2000 was 24.5.

* In 2007, only China and India had populations greater than 1000, showing their demographic dominance.
  
* Europeâ€™s population decreased by 8 units from 2000 to 2010, hinting at declining birth rates or increased migration.

# ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

The analysis reveals clear population trends and disparities across continents. While Asia leads in population, Europe shows signs of demographic decline. South America and Africa display moderate values, whereas Oceania has the lowest figures. These findings are critical for governments in strategizing policies around population management, infrastructure, and resource allocation.

# ðŸ“Œ Recommendations

* Asia: Implement robust population control and urban planning strategies.

* Europe: Introduce pro-natal policies (childcare subsidies, family tax relief) to counter population decline.

* Oceania and smaller continents: Encourage migration and regional development.

* Global: Use outlier detection to monitor abnormal population changes and address root causes (e.g., conflict, climate change, migration).
